**Hello Everybody!**

_About Me_
I have an array of diverse skills. They include literary and cultural interpretation, advanced research methods, clear and persuasive writing, critical thinking, organization, and project management skills. I am also technologically minded and love working with graphic design software such as Aobde Illustrator. This GitHub page is a stage to showcase some of my skills on a public platform. It is also a place where I can practice working with GitHub pull requests from VS Code. My HTML and CSS skills are improving.

_My Experience_
I am experienced with data. I consider myself Excel savvy and work with Power Query a lot. I enjoy cleaning data which is an odd thing according to some of my colleagues. Below is a list of projects that required my expertise:

Lead generation which consisted of purchasing D&B lists, washing them against a source list so that new leads could be targeted by sales and tracked by management.
Extracting, transforming, loading different sources of data into relatable tables.
Performing data queries using SQL.
vLookups, hLookups and, Power Pivot Tables.
Data Link Library

The following is a list of open dataset links to reference when performing Tableau visualizations and analysis.

NJOIT Open Data Center
NJDEP Open Data
Rutgers University Data Planet
NJIT Common Datasets
New Jersey State Health Assessment Data
Kaggle Datasets


_Database Design_
Designing databases is a great way to understand how a business works. Seeing workflows as tables and realtionships reveals redundancy and inconsistency. The most recent project needed a bridge databases that connnect two enterprise systems who share clients and tasks thorugh via a ticketing system. It was built using SQLite3 in Python with a user interface to update the database. When they are ready they will move the database to their Azure platform

_Python_
Python is a coding language I plan to learn fluently. I understand it does not solve any or all problems but thinking in Python offers a proactive method to noodle out a solution with very little investment. 

_AWS Cloud Practioner_
I passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practioner exam in July of 2019.

_Tableau and Power BI_
In addition to using Tableau, I am expereienced using Power BI. I would not rate one over the other. Each program has pros and cons. Since learning Python, I am not sure I can go back to no code programs. However, both programs rest in a sweet spot when it comes to analysis. I lose myself in the research process and I find it to be quite relazing. The following Tableau public link will open a visualization I created. It regards University spend.

_Digitization_
Scanning pages from books might seem mundane but as part of research, transforming physical to digital it informative and beneficial. As an intern at Stockon, I managed to spend a little time in special archives preserving history. I hope I get to continue as a alumna.
