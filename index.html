        Hello Everybody!
    </h1>
    <p>
        I'm trying out GitHub Pages for training purposes. I'll be adding CSS but for now stuckieboss is just an HTML file.

    <h2>
        About Me
    </h2>

    <h3>My Experience.</h3>
        <p>I feel pretty fortunate about the opportunities I have experienced during my career in IT. 
            But... 
            Due to a variety of reasons and shortcomings, my career path has been much like a hike on Mount Washington; filled with obstacles and deviations.
            I can't place the blame on anything in particular. Life happens. Insecurities float under the surface. A person gets too comfortable. 
            I was never one of those people who knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up. I had some ideas. 
            Once I got my hands in them, I realized that I wasn't on board with the path. Even college turned out to be a disappointment. I studied Italian. I already knew Italian!
            I think it happens to a lot of people. 
            One day, after a lot of frustration, I decided to take a class about Microsoft Excel. 
            Even though I had never been a numbers person, Excel provided opportunities I had never really considered. 
            I learned I was pretty good at it! 
            And, because of that one little program, my world expanded beyond what I had considered. 
            Learning Excel offered me a little courage. 
            So much courage in fact that I left my little town in New Jersey and ended up being hired at an IT reseller in Kittery, Maine.
            I learned as much as I could while I worked for that organization. I learned about sales strategies, procuring IT in the Channel, distribution, and technology. 
            It was a nice ride. 
            </p>
            <p>
            But, I boxed myself in. I never really went beyond being a support person. 
            The responsibility of being a full-fledged sales person was too daunting.
            Fortunately, a successful salesperson at the reseller decided to open up his own company. 
            He asked if I would help him. 
            It seemed like the ultimate support role and for over a decade, it was great. 
            I helped him put all the pieces together so his company could function. He called one of his cornerstones. 
            I learned how each piece of software worked and figured out how to integrate each of the pieces. I automated. I reported. I made money for the company without being a salesperson.
            But, I got bored. 
            There were no challenges left that I was willing to try to solve. 
            Oh sure, I could have gone into sales. But sales is a scary place. 
            Every month you start at zero. 
            I didn't feel talented enough, strong enough to work past the 'no' factor. 
            It takes a lot of work to build a relationship, put a quote together, get special pricing, submit an RFP, and add it to your funnel; only to hear, "we've decided to go with another vendor".
            It's a little heartbreaking.
            At least, for me.
            </p>

        <p>So I took a chance and left my comfort zone to try something new and different. 
            This time, I started at the bottom of a design experience company. Talk about repetitive work! 
            I had no say about anything. My previous experience wasn't even considered. All I had to do was finish a list of tasks.
            While it paid the bills, it was very unfulfilling. 
            Then one day, my boss asked me to figure out how to track our progress. 
            My old friend Excel helped me out once again. I combined the never-ending worksheets into one clear visualization filled with KPIs and graphs. 
            From then on I was her go-to Excel person. 
            Finally, I felt I had some traction. 
            Other folks in the organization noticed and it felt as if my career was back on the move. 
            I had the opportunity to move to the web development team and grabbed it.
            Even though my knowledge of code was limited, I was able to support the team and I felt comfortable once again.
            Things were chugging a long nicely. 
            I was learning a ton and felt pretty good about everything. 
            Then the pandemic landed and I got the dreaded phone call.
            </p>

        <p>Now at this point, I'm on in years. I'm not the young super support person I was. 
            I've seen things. 
            Life became more real. 
            Insecurities are more obvious.
            The realization that retirement is closer than an internship stings.
            While my skills and experience are lovely, my chances of anyone noticing them are reduced to virtually nothing.
           
            There are people looking for the same jobs I am that are younger, hungrier, more savvy, and more polished. 
            If I want a job, one that is more than the ones I had, I need to focus.

            So what do you do when you get laid off?
            Well, you get a little sad and hopefully, you get over it.
            I had never been let go from a job before so I sat in shock for a little bit.
            Maybe, too long.
            Then I got over myself. 
            I took inventory of my skills. 
            I forced myself to identify where I was coming up short.
            Talk about uncomfortable.
            I realized I needed to show my value instead of just talk about it.
        </p>

        <p>Where does a person begin?
            If you're me, you head to Excel and you make yourself a list.
            On this list, you decided what certifications you want to achieve and begin to learn all you can.
            You take stock in the things you were kind of good at and become better at them.
            You pass. 
            You fail. 
            You try again.
            You keep going.
        </p>

        <p>I won't claim to teach anyone about anything here.
            If this repository serves any purpose, it should document what I have used to try and learn something. 
            Topics I hope to cover will be about SQL, the Cloud, Networking, and Project Management.
            I hope to improve my HTML and CSS skills while working out the kinks with pushing and pulling commits to GitHub.
            While I have worked in all of these spaces to some extent, I can only hope to benefit from expanding my experience.

            As Mike Meyers says, "heat and pressure make diamonds"

        <h2>SQL
        </h2>

        <p>While Excel is my friend, SQL has been an acquaintance.
            I've been in databases. I've updated, queried, and joined some tables together. 
            I've exported or extracted to Excel because it was easier to get the information needed.
            I've asked the DBA if he could just add a column and heard him laugh at my request.
            But now, it's on. 
            SQL and I are going to find a primary key, join each other, and make a relationship we can visualize.

           

        <p>My goal with SQL is to pass the MTA 98-364 Database Fundamentals exam.
            I've used phpMyAdmin because that's web based and its part of LAMP stacks but, because I want to pass the Microsoft exam, I'll focus on the
            SQL Express, a free version to download and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 
            My plan is to use a book by Sylvia Moestal Vasilk called SQL Practice Problems. 
            I've started a Udemy course with practice tests so that I can study.
            I've got a little time left on a GMetrix course I signed up for so I'll use that, too. 
            But to be honest, I prefer the Udemy course and practice tests.
              
        </p>

        <h2>CompTia A+
        </h2>

        <p>I got a little too big for my britches and took the core 1 exam too soon. 
            I failed the first time but I can promise you, that will not happen again. Its not that its a hard exam but it isn't east either. 
        </p>

        <h2>AWS Cloud
        </h2>

        <p>I've already passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practioner exam in July. 
            At first that was my only goal regarding the Cloud but based on my reflection, I realize that my future lies in the Cloud.
