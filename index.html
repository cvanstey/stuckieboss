    About Me
    </h2>
    <p>With an anticipated degree in Literature, I have acquired an array of diverse skills. They include literary and cultural interpretation, advanced research methods, clear and persuasive writing, critical thinking, organization, and project management skills. I am also technologically minded and love working with graphic design software such as Illustrator. 
    
    This GitHub page is a stage to showcase some of my skills on a public platform. It is also a place where I can practice working with GitHub pull requests from VS Code. My HTML and CSS skills are improving.</p>

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>I have experience with data. My list of projects inlcude lead generation which consisted of purchasing D&B lists, washing them against a source list so that new leads could be targeted by sales and tracked by management. I consider myself Excel savvy and work with Power Query a lot. For some reason I like cleaning data which is an odd thing according to some of my colleagues. In addition to using Tableau, I enjoy using Power BI. I would not rate one over the other. Both programs have a sweet spot when it comes to analysis. I find I lose myself in the research process and I do not seem to mind.
