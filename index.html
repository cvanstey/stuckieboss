Hello Everybody!

<p>
I'm trying out GitHub Pages for training purposes. I'll be adding CSS but for now stuckieboss is just an HTML file.

About Me
</h2>
</div>

<div>
<h3>My Experience.</h3>
<p>I feel pretty fortunate about the opportunities I have experienced during my career in IT. 
<p>But...</p> 
<p>Due to a variety of reasons and shortcomings, my career path has been much like a hike on Mount Washington; filled with obstacles and deviations.
I can't place the blame on anything in particular. Life happens. Insecurities float under the surface. A person gets too comfortable. 
I was never one of those people who knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up. I had some ideas. 
Once I got my hands in them, I realized that I wasn't on board with the path. Even college turned out to be a disappointment.
I think it happens to a lot of people.</p>
<p>One day, after a lot of frustration, I decided to take an in person class on Microsoft Excel. 
I had never been a numbers person. Yet, Excel provided opportunities I had never really considered. 
I learned I was pretty good at it! 
And, because of that one little program, my world expanded beyond the options I thought were available. 
Learning Excel offered me a little courage. 
So much courage, in fact, that I left my little town in New Jersey and ended up being hired at an IT reseller in Kittery, Maine.
I learned as much as I could while I worked for that organization. I learned about sales strategies, procuring IT in the Channel, distribution, and technology.</p>
<p>It was a nice ride. </p>
<p>
But, I boxed myself in. I never really went beyond being a support person. 
The responsibility of being a full-fledged sales person was too daunting.
Fortunately, I was invited to work for a start-up reseller. 
It seemed like the ultimate support role and for over a decade, it was great. 
</p>
<p> 
I helped the owner put all the pieces together so his company could function. He called me one of his cornerstones. 
I learned how each piece of software worked and figured out how to integrate each of the pieces. I automated. I reported. 
I made money for the company without being a salesperson.
But, I got bored. 
There were no challenges left that I was willing to try to solve. 
Oh sure, I could have gone into sales. But sales can be a scary place.
</p> 
<p>
Every month you start at zero.</p> 

<p>I didn't feel talented enough, strong enough to work past the 'no' factor. 
It takes a lot of work to build a relationship, put a quote together, get special pricing, submit an RFP, and add it to your funnel; only to hear, "we've decided to go with another vendor".
It's a little heartbreaking.
At least, for me.
</p>

<p>So I took a chance and left my comfort zone to try something new and different. 
This time, I started at the bottom of a design experience company. Very repetitive work! 
I had no say about anything. My previous experience wasn't even considered. All I had to do was finish a list of tasks.
While it paid the bills, it was very unfulfilling. 
Then one day, my boss asked me to figure out how to track our progress. 
My old friend Excel helped me out once again. I combined the never-ending worksheets into one clear visualization filled with KPIs and graphs. 
From then on I was her go-to Excel person. I was set up with a Power Bi Professional license. I was creating lists in SharePoint, making flows and forms.</p>
<p>Finally, my skills were understood and utilized.</p> 
<p>Other folks in the organization noticed and it felt as if my career was picking up steam.
I was given the opportunity to move to the web development team and grabbed it with both hands.
Even though my knowledge of code was limited, I was able to support the team and I felt comfortable once again.
Things were chugging a long nicely. 
I was learning a ton and feeling pretty good about everything.</p>
<p>
Then the pandemic landed.
</p>
<p>I got the dreaded phone call.</p>

<p>
At this point in my life, I'm not the young eager to please person I was. 
I've seen things. 
Life has become more real. 
My insecurities are more obvious to me.
The realization that retirement is closer than an internship stings.
While my skills and experience are lovely, my chances of anyone noticing them seem reduced to virtually nothing.
</p>

<p>There are people looking for the same jobs I am. They are younger, hungrier, more savvy, and more polished in a lot of ways. 
If I want MY job, one that is more than the ones I've had, I need to sharpen my focus.</p>

<p>What do you do when you get laid off?</p>
<p>I had never been let go from a job before so I sat in shock for a little bit.</p>
<p>Maybe, too long.</p>
<p>Then I got over myself. </p>
<p>I took inventory of my skills. 
I forced myself to identify where I was coming up short.</p>
<p>Talk about uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I realized I needed to show my value instead of just talk about it.</p>

<p>Where does a person begin?</p>
<p>If you're me, you head to Excel and you make yourself a list.
On this list, you decide what certifications you want to achieve and begin to learn all you can.
You take stock in the things you were kind of good at then you work to become better at them.</p>
<p>You succeed.</p> 
<p>You fail.</p> 
<p>You try again.</p>
<p>You keep going.</p>

<p>I won't claim to teach anyone about anything here.
If this repository serves any purpose, it should document what I have used to try to expand upon my skillset. 
Topics I hope to cover will be about SQL, the Cloud, Networking, and Project Management.
I hope to improve my HTML and CSS skills while working out the kinks with pushing and pulling commits to GitHub.
While I have worked in all of these spaces to some extent, I can only hope to benefit from expanding my experience. </p>

<p>As Mike Meyers says, "heat and pressure make diamonds".</p>

<h2>SQL
</h2>
</div> 

<div>
<p>While Excel is my friend, SQL has been an acquaintance.
I've been in databases. I've updated, queried, and joined some tables together. I've helped design a table or two.
I've exported or extracted to Excel because it was easier to get the information needed.
I've asked the DBA if he could just add a column and heard him laugh at my request.

<p>But now, it's on. 
SQL and I are going to find a primary key, join, and make a relationship that can be visualized.</p>

<p>My goal with SQL is to pass the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/98-364">MTA 98-364 Database Fundamentals exam.</a> I've used phpMyAdmin because that's web based and its part of LAMP stacks but, because I want to pass the Microsoft exam, I'll focus on
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads">SQL Express</a>, a free version to download and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. You can download SMSS after you download SQL Express. It is contained within the download.
<p>One thing about downloading that I ran into was I was getting an error when I tried to download SMSS. I had read about it and there were all of these suggestions. In the end, I opted to change where I downloaded the file to. I've got Windows 10 Home and the download defaulted to Program Files (x86). I choose Program Files and it worked fine.</p>

I have Sylvia Moestl Vasilik's book called <em><strong>SQL Practice Problems</strong></em>. You can buy it on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Practice-Problems-learn-doing-ebook/dp/B01N41VQFO"> Amazon.</a>
<p>I've started a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-microsoft-sql/">Udemy course</a> with <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/mta-98-364-database-fundamentals-prep-exam/">practice tests</a> so that I can study.</p>
<p>I've got a little time left on a <a href="https://www.gmetrix.com/">GMetrix</a> course I signed up for so I'll use that, too.</p> 

<p>To be honest, I prefer the Udemy course and practice tests over GMetrix.</p> Once I take the exam, I'll have more of an opinion of which served me better.

<p>The exam covers the items listed on the <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4tnJq">Exam Skills Outline</a>
</p>

<p><strong>Skills measured</strong>
<ol>Understanding core database concepts (20–25%)</ol>
<ol>Create database objects (20–25%)</ol>
<ol>Manipulate data (25–30%)</ol>
<ol>Understand data storage (15–20%)</ol>
<ol>Administer a database (10–15%)</ol>
</p>

<h2>CompTia A+
</h2>
</div>

<div>
<p>I got a little too big for my britches and took the core 1 exam too soon. 
I failed the first time but I can promise you, that will not happen again. Its not that its a hard exam but it isn't easy either. 
</p>

<h2>AWS Cloud
</h2>
</div>

<div>
<p>I've already passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practioner exam in July. 
At first that was my only goal regarding the Cloud but based on my reflection, I realize that the future lies in the Cloud.
I probably should have realized this much, much sooner.
Once you understand how to apply cloud services to different scenarios, its a real eye opener.
Its important to understand how networks operate. Intent and purpose, setup, monitoring, security, analytics; the Cloud offers a bounty of opportunity to keep the mind busy.
As crazy as it seems, I feel its pretty natural for me to continue learning about Amazon Web Services and how I can incorporate it into my future.
While I plan on gaining knowledge about Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Services, for now, I'm sticking with AWS. I'm comfortable with it ( there's that word again) and I've already bought the Udemy course for AWS Certified Solution Associate with practice exams.
I've also built some labs in AWS and I like the console.
