    <h2>
        ways I have made a website
    </h2>

    <ol>
        using visual studio
        <em>doing a control o to get the html file</em>
        using Bitnami
        <em>needed to buy a domain</em>
        using aws lightsail
        <em>reused the same domain that I bought, hosted for 3.50 a month</em>
        using an AWS AMI with wordpress and linux already loaded
        <em>reused the same domain, cost associated with the LAMP. It was .012/hr</em>
        used an EC2 instance and loaded a LAMP stack using SSH
        using github pages
        <em>used a repository on github with a different domain</em>
    </ol>

    </ol>
